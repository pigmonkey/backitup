# Execute a user-specified command if a certain amount of time has passed.
# 
# If the specified command exits successfully (ie, with an exit code of zero) the
# current timestamp is saved in a file. Every time the script runs, it checks the
# timestamp stored in the file. If the timestamp is greater than a user-specified
# period, the specified command is executed.

# It is recommended that this file be *inside* the directory to be backed up.

# Define the backup command.
BACKUP="$HOME/bin/tarsnapper.py"

# Define the command to be executed if the file which holds the time of the
# previous backup does not exist. The default behaviour here is to simply
# create the file, which will then cause the backup to be executed. If the
# directory you specified above is a mount point, the file not existing may
# indicate that the filesystem is not mounted. In that case, you would place
# your mount command in this string. If you want the script to exit when the
# file does not exist, simply set this to a blank string.
NOFILE='touch $LASTRUN'

# Define the period, in seconds, for backups to attempt to execute.
# Hourly:   3600
# Daily:    86400
# Weekly:   604800
# The period may also be set to the string 'DAILY', 'WEEKLY' or 'MONTHLY'.
# Note that this will result in behaviour that is different from setting the
# period to the equivalent seconds.
PERIOD='DAILY'

# Define whether the backup should only be attempted on AC power.
ACONLY='False'

# Set the default verbosity level.
